## Setup
1. Download the Woolridge datasets from [here](https://l.messenger.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cengage.com%2Faise%2Feconomics%2Fwooldridge_3e_datasets%2F&h=AT0Mxu-uk579W9aKmkaQXOE9aJNkT7S5ZFqJAzvqIp9sHfXxQrng7yL_9vhnlMAVZPrIAd4TycBfRueWHNr4tPKisORhWtOFOuHVo-NcszcioVCIs3J8lcChKeHEeQ).
2. Extract the necessary datasets and capitalize the filenames (including the extension).

## Instructions
1. Change the working directory to the git root directory.
2. Run the R scripts and store their output in correspondingly-named `.out` files, as follows:
  ```
  Rscript c6.9.R > c6.9.out
  ```
  The name of the `.out` file should be the same as the R script file, but with the `.out` extension instead of the `.R` extension.
  eg. `q_We.RtY.R` => `q_We.RtY.out`
3. Compile the LaTeX report after generating all `.out` files for each R script.
